# About

## Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is Shing, and I’m a full-stack programmer with expertise in Java, Golang, PHP, JavaScript. For backend development, I’m skilled in using Spring Boot, Hyperf, and Beego frameworks, and the Vue.js framework for front-end development. I also have experience in developing desktop applications using Electron and mobile applications using React Native.

I’m passionate about programming and enjoy tackling complex challenges to develop efficient and effective solutions. I believe that programming is not just about writing code, but also about understanding business needs, collaborating with team members, and delivering high-quality results.
