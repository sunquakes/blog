# Quickly create a desktop application

## Introduction

There are many ways to create a desktop application, Winforms and WPF in windows, swift in macOS, and some cross-platform solutions like qt, electron, etc. In this article, I will show you how to quickly create a desktop application using `electron-kits`, a electron-based cross-platform solution.

`electron-kits` is using `Anti Design Vue` as the UI framework. It is a Vue-based UI framework, which is very easy to use and has a lot of components, there is already login page, layout component, menu component, list page etc. and it is using `sqlite3` as the database, as the mainstream solution for app database, `sqlite3` is very lightweight and fast, the `electron-kits` offers create/read/update/delete operate methods for database.
